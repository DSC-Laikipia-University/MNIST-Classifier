# MNIST-Classifier

__MNIST__ is a dataset containing 28 by 28 pixel sized grayscale images. This dataset is large, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. It has two variants: [__MNIST Handwitten Digits__](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) which contains images from 0 - 9, and [__FASHION MNIST__](https://research.zalando.com/welcome/mission/research-projects/fashion-mnist/) which contains images classified as 0 - T-shit/Top, 1 - Trouser, 2 - Pullover, 3 - Dress, 4 - Coat, 5 -  Sandal, 6 - Shirt, 7 - Sneaker, 8 - Bag, and 9 - Ankle boot.
